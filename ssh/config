# Define name and port for access sshd. Previously
# I had most/all of my computers statically allocated
# IPv4 addresses and gave each of them a unique ssh port
# By doing this I could use port fowarding on the router
# to ssh into any of the computers. I've decied this is
# overly complex and a potential security problem. Therefore
# all internal computers will use port 22, the default,
# for ssh and have dynamically defined IPv4 addresses.
# This is now possible because I'm using dnsmasg which has
# a builtin DNS and DHCP service that are coordinated and
# so I can consistently access devices using their hostnames.
# I initially had problems with macosx machines but after
# disabling IPv6 in dnsmasq all hostnames are consistently
# resolved.
