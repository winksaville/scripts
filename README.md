# Scripts

These are scripts I've created over time and
when initializing a Linux system I clone this
from github as soon as possible copy:

- bashrc to ~/.bashrc
- vimrc to ~/.vimrc
- gpg.conf to ~/.gnupg/
- dirmngr.conf to ~/.gnupg/
- gitconfig to ~/.gitconfig
- gitignore to ~/.gitignore

Note: keep git-completion.bash upto date.
